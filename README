screw it lets make a very very simple game
think chrome dino thingy

Sooo
you are on a subway inside a tunnel because thats freaking awesome
you can jump and thats about it (maybe add movement later)
and you need to jump when stuff happens

to simplify: you stay still, things move R2L towards you, jump to avoid them
